# Creating Custom 3D-Printing Material Colors Using Optical Modeling of Waste Plastic (SpecOptiBlend)


This open-source software aids in identifying the ideal ratio of each spectral data component for the reconstruction of a sample when only its spectral information is available.
Here, it was used to reconstruct Western University's Purple color but, it can be applied to any other color.


## A Background

1. Subtractive Color Mixing:
   - Light interacts with substances (dyes/pigments).
   - Certain wavelengths are absorbed, and others are reflected.
   - Results in perceived colors.
